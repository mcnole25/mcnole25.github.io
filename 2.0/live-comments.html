"Am I the only one who thinks Glomble is getting faster & faster every day? It seems the devs are up to something",
"As I mentioned before the video got deleted, hyped for the optimized version of this!",
"best part about glomble is the dislike button. oh i so dearly missed it on all the socials",
"Bro, what is this WITCHCRAFT??",
"btw check the previous video, thats the second part of it. in that video i improved this script and made it easier to use!",
"But if someone isn't afraid to risk or something...",
"Damm, my computer is about to explode, im rendering my blender and typing ****, it's polygon heavy my boy,",
"Dang this is helpful",
"deja vu",
"Either I'm incredibly stupid or it's not working",
"fellow brave user",
"For those who are having trouble watching the video:",
"Get this back to the top of the recommended tab NOW!!",
"Get this to the top of the reccomended page so all creators have an easier time uploading here üìé",
"Hey guys its @BioLogic here",
"How i can make it work on win 10? it doesn't have open in windows terminal",
"I don't understand how to use Python. I feel like there could have been more explaining on how to make the \"Compress.Py\" file, as I cannot figure out how to use Python for the life of me. Also I can't download the script, as I can only copy it",
"I just use Handbrake and change the resolution to 480p30.",
"I'd love it if Glomble implemented this as an option when uploading a video.",
"I'd reccomend making it a program and putting it on git-hub",
"I'm gonna Glomble it so hard",
"IDK how the **** this video got deleted! i was deleting the pinned comment and damn the video got deleted all of a sudden T_T my views and likes and comments omg!",
"It will be easy for Glomble and other websites where the bandwidth is not much",
"keep getting an error saying \"sys\" not defined",
"Looking by it's score I can assume this video would be presented to the aliens or smth",
"No extra work or files needed, just upload, click on compress video and done! Fast loading video with same quality without risking a virus.",
"Pastebin seems to be really scummy. it's giving me all of these pop up ads and crap. is there anywhere else i can get the code (like GitHub)?",
"RIP computer",
"So that viewers can enjoy your video without buffering.",
"thanks :D",
"thanks this worked! my 1gb video became 100mb and it uploaded way easier",
"There are also some online websites for compressing videos, but... noone knows what *some random website* is doing with your video you sent there.",
"This platform is starting of really good, the notepad to communicate to the audience, the music in the background, it feels very nice",
"This video gives me such 2015 vibes im gonna cry of nostalgia (‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•)",
"This will be so helpful! Thank you very much",
"Today I am going to show how you can compress your videos without losing any quality",
"we gonna glomblers instread of youtubers, the world i healing",
"well that's pretty much the worst way I could find out about a bug, I'm really sorry! I can't really bring back the likes and views because I'd have to know which profiles liked and viewed it. I'll make the score 1 trillion temporarily to make up for this",
"What a loss.",
"what the HELL is that score",
"Wish I found this BEFORE uploadingüò≠üò≠üò≠",
