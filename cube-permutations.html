<h1>1x2x3 Cube Permutations</h1>

<p>All possible scrambles of the 1x2x3 Rubik's cube. There are 48 permutations, and we can demonstrate how.</p>
<p>Consider just the top face of the puzzle. With only 180Â° turns, we can move the top, left, right, or bottom parts. To preserve orientation, let's say top and bottom moves are identical. This means the lower middle cubie will be in a fixed position.</p>
<p>For the 5 cubies from the top face, there are only 12 possible orientations. For the red/orange side, since one of them is in a fixed position, we get only 4 possibilities. Red/Red/Red, Red/Red/Orange, Orange/Red/Red, Orange/Red/Orange.</p>
<p>For certain arrangements, the pattern is different and it depends on the green/blue side. Orientation of the puzzle is disregarded, so all of these patterns are unique.</p>
<p>However, here is an image for all 96 colourings of the cube. (with orientation)</p>
