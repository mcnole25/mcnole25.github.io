<br>
How long will mcnole25.github.io, my website, last?<br>
<br>
Github is designed to last a millenium, so it probably won't be gone anytime soon.<br>
The chances are low, but never 0. I think it will last until at least 2100, taking potential future world disasters into account.<br>
<br>
Speaking of world disasters, you might already be going through AI concerns, climate change, political issues, heavy responsibilities, or whatever unfavorable circumstances are happening in the future.<br>
<br>
But still, it's always a good idea to take a step back & appreciate the positives life offers.<br>
<br>
I've been creating things on the internet since 2018. If you are inspired to create things, that's amazing!<br>
You will only ever live once. Your life is the only opportunity you get to create your own online adventure.<br>
<br>
Sadly, my creations have been "silenced" for years, I'm not a famous person, so I receive very little recognition. But don't fret about fame too much, the joy of creating is the main picture.<br>
<br>
Goodbye, to whoever is reading this! This is not my final creation, I hope to create stuff for as long as desired.<br>
